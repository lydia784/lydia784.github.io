            <h2>Story Behind It</h2>
            <p>While facing financial hardship during his exile in Huangzhou following the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial, Su Dongpo innovated upon the conventional method of preparing pork. He marinated the pork in a mixture of huangjiu (yellow wine), rock sugar, and soy sauce, and simmered it on low heat for long hours.</p>
            <p>He composed a poem titled "An Ode to Pork," where he described that pork was a most affordable meat source locally, and by a slow cooking method, he obtained both a delicacy and a survival food for the families. The recipe was subsequently adopted and developed by people in the Hangzhou area, the capital city of South Song Dynasty.</p>

            <h3>猪肉颂 Ode to Pork</h3>
            <pre>
净洗铛，少著水 / Clean your pot, add but a little water
柴头罨烟焰不起。/ Light the stove, keep the smoke at bay.
待他自熟莫催他，/ It’s done when it’s done—how pointless to rush,
火候足时他自美。/ With heat and time, a thing of beauty emerges.
黄州好猪肉，价贱如泥土。/ Huangzhou has good pork, and cheap as dirt.
贵者不肯吃，贫者不解煮，/ The rich won’t eat it; the common-folk don’t know how,
早晨起来打两碗，/ I eat two bowls for breakfast,
饱得自家君莫管。/ And I’m satisfied, with not a care in the world.
            </pre>
